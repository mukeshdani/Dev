Utilized technologies like React, Django, and Docker to ensure high performance and scalability. Enhanced data security by 97%. Leveraged generative AI to automate candidate profiling, resume parsing, and intelligent matching: - Used OpenAI GPT-4 to analyze and categorize candidate profiles based on skills and experience. - Implemented resume parsing algorithms using NLP techniques (e.g., NER, section classification, skill extraction) to convert unstructured resumes into structured data. - Applied semantic similarity and rule-based filters to match candidates with job requirements. - Developed intelligent ranking models to prioritize best-fit candidates based on historical hiring patterns and recruiter feedback. Built a recruiter assistant chatbot using OpenAI API and LangChain Agents to provide real-time access. The chatbot acts as a conversational interface for recruiters to: - Retrieve real-time hiring metrics such as open requisitions and candidate pipeline status. - Summarize candidate profiles and interview feedback using LLM-based summarization. - Automate repetitive queries and trigger workflows like interview scheduling or status updates. This significantly reduces manual dashboard navigation and enhances recruiter productivity through natural language interaction.",
