  SOAP                                             REST
1. Protocol                                       Architectural style
2. function-driven                                Data-driven access a resource for data 
   transfer structured information       
3. Only using XML                                 Permits many data formate including plain text , xml , html and json 
4. Supported ws-security and ssl                  supported ssl and http 
5. Required more resource and bandwidth           Required fewer resource and is lighweight 
6. can not be catched                             can be catched 
7. (payload Handling ) Has a strict                needs no knowledge of the api 
    communication contract and needs          
    knowledge of everthing before 
   interaction 
8. (ACID complliance)  Has build-in ACID          Lasks ACID complliance
   compllience to reduce anomalies 







SOAP is only used post for all
